## Development Process
This car racing game was developed using Unreal Engine 5. Here's a brief overview of the development process:

1. **Importing and Rigging the Car in Blender**: The car model was created and rigged in Blender 3D, then imported into Unreal Engine.
   
2. **Making the Car Drivable in Unreal Engine 5**: Using Unreal Engine's built-in physics and vehicle systems, the car was configured to be drivable within the game environment.

3. **Texturing and Configuring the Car**: Textures and materials were applied to the car model to enhance its visual appearance, and configurations were made to optimize its performance within the game.

4. **Creating Gameplay Elements**: Gameplay elements such as checkpoints, a timer system, and a finish line were implemented to provide structure and challenge to the racing experience.

5. **Building the Environment**: A city environment with realistic roads, buildings, and other assets was created to serve as the backdrop for the racing game.

6. **Adding Additional Features**: Features like a speedometer and non-player character (NPC) cars from the Epic Games Marketplace were integrated to enhance the gameplay experience.

## Note
- The `RacingGameCourse.exe` file is the executable that allows you to play the game locally. Ensure you have all other files and folders from this repository downloaded for the game to function properly.
- Your PC should have gaming-grade configurations for better FPS and maneuverability of the car in the game.

Enjoy playing the game and feel free to explore the project.
