# My-Unreal-Engine-Game-Project
Created a hyper-realistic car racing game from scratch using Unreal Engine 5! This repository contains all the files necessary to play the game locally on your PC.  Developed as part of a course on Udemy, this project showcases skills in game development, 3D modeling, and Unreal Engine. Feel free to explore the project.
